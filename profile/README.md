## Summary
Hi there, welcome to my #algorithms organization. I am enthusiastic in learning algorithms because it has the potential to make me more money, but also I am in love with the learning process. I hope you enjoy my learning process!

## Goals
My goal is to ultimately get this to become a popular repository for people to learn and see the history of problems that I've encountered in my career. It is a combination of self-study and my professional work.
